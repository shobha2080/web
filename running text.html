namely the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National 
Congress dominating the politics at the national level. 
The Bharatiya Janata Party has governed the country with Narendra Modi 
at the helm since 2014. The tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha is scheduled 
to end on 16 June 2024.[4] The previous general election was held 
in April–May 2019, after which the, National Democratic Alliance, led by 
the Bharatiya Janata Party, formed the union government, with Modi continuing

<h3><b>Electoral system</b></h3>

Article 83 of the Constitution of India requires elections to the 
Lok Sabha to be held once every five years.[6] All 543 elected MPs 
are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.
 The 104th amendment to the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved
 for the Anglo-Indian community.
Eligible voters must be Indian citizens, 18 years or older, ordinary 
resident of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote 
(name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification

 card issued by the Election Commission of India or equivalent.[9] Some people 
convicted of electoral or other offenses are barred from voting.[10] Indians holding 
foreign citizenship are also barred from voting. There is no postal or online absentee 
voting in India; members of the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home
 constituencies in order to cast a ballot.[11]

For the 2024 election, 968 million people are eligible to vote, an increase of 
about 150 million people from the 2019 election.[12] In Arunachal Pradesh, a polling
 station will be set up for the only registered voter in the village of Malogam, due t
o electoral laws that stipulate voting booths to be placed within two kilometers from 
all settlements.[13][14][15] A polling station was also set up inside the Gir Forest in 
Gujarat to cater for a singular voter, a priest at a Hindu temple.[16] Polling stations
 will also be set up inside a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala and in a shipping container in 
Gujarat,[17] as well as in 320 relief camps hosting some 59,000 people displaced during 
interethnic violence in Manipur.[18]

In March 2024, the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress Party to end the usage of electronic voting machines and revert to paper ballots and manual counting, which was the system used in elections until the late 1990s, with the party citing risks of electoral fraud.[19] Nearly 5.5 million electronic voting machines will be utilized for more than one million polling stations, while 15 million election workers and security personnel will be tasked with managing the conduct of the election.[15]

For the first time, the Election Commission of India allowed voters with disabilities and those over the age of 85 to cast ballots from their homes due to concerns over high temperatures. In Telangana, voting in some precincts was extended by a later hour to allow voters to come at a more convenient time.[20]

<h3><b>Planning</b></h3>


Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involve monitoring campaign expenditure, preventing the circulation of illicit goods, and ensuring adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. In the final 48 hours before voting, campaigns are ended, and measures are implemented to maintain order and prevent disruptions. On polling day, strict rules are enforced to prevent undue influence, ensuring a smooth and secure election process. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are sealed and stored with tight security measures, while Booth Level Officers assist voters throughout the process
